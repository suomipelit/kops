No Setup/Configuration Utility?
-------------------------------

That's true. The DOS to Win32 port was made rather quickly and I didn't
have time to make a new windows application for configuring the control
keys etc. Below is a list of default keys you have to stick with. If you
are a programmer, see the end of this file for configuration file format.

Player 1
       UP	Cursor up
       LEFT	Cursor left
       RIGHT	Cursor right
       FIRE	Right shift
       SPECIAL	Cursor down

Player 2
       UP	[W]
       LEFT	[A]
       RIGHT	[D]
       FIRE	Left shift
       SPECIAL	[S]

Player 3
       UP	[Y]
       LEFT	[G]
       RIGHT	[J]
       FIRE	[F]
       SPECIAL	[H]

Player 4
       UP	[L]
       LEFT	[,]
       RIGHT	[/] (en) or [-] (fi)
       FIRE	M
       SPECIAL	[.]


Information for programmers
---------------------------
If you want to code your own setup utility, below is the file format of
the configuration file KOPS.CFG. Note that if the file does not exist,
file is invalid or the file is wrong version, game automatically creates
a new one with default settings. 
List of key symbols can be found in SDL documentation/headers
(see http://www.libsdl.org).
